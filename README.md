  + "Azure subscriptions are a grouping of resources with an assigned owner
    responsible for billing and permissions management. Unlike AWS, where any
    resources created under the AWS account are tied to that account,
    subscriptions exist independently of their owner accounts, and can be
    reassigned to new owners as needed."
  + Subscriptions are assigned three types of administrator accounts:
    * Account Administrator
    * Service Administrator
    * Co-administrator
  + "Like AWS accounts, subscriptions have default service quotas and limits.
    For a full list of these limits, see Azure subscription and service limits,
    quotas, and constraints."

## Low Priority VMs
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-low-priority-vms-on-vm-scale-sets/
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-low-priority
  + "The amount of available unutilized capacity can vary based on size, region, time of day, and more. When deploying low-priority VMs on scale sets, Azure will allocate the VMs if there is capacity available, but there is no SLA for these VMs. A low-priority scale set is deployed in a single fault domain and offers no high availability guarantees."
- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/low-priority-scale-sets/
  + "Low-priority VMs are available through VM scale sets with up to an 80 percent discount."
  + "Low-priority VMs enable you to take advantage of our unutilized capacity. The amount of available unutilized capacity can vary based on size, region, time of day, and more. When deploying Low-priority VMs in VM scale sets, Azure will allocate the VMs if there is capacity available, but there are no SLA guarantees. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, we will evict low-priority VMs"
  + "viction Policy: When provisioning low-priority VMs, you can set the eviction policy. The two evictions policies that are supported are stop-deallocate on eviction and deleted on eviction. Stop-deallocate on eviction allows users to maintain the disks associated with these VMs. Users can try to restart the low priority in the scale set but remember, there are no allocation guarantees. The delete on eviction policy deletes the VM and all disks associated to the VM. "
- https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2017/11/07/microsoft-azure-low-priority-virtual-machines-take-advantage-of-surplus-capacity-in-azure/
  + "In general, batch processing workloads are a good fit, as jobs are broken into many parallel tasks or there are many jobs that are scaled out and distributed across many VMs."
    + "Development and testing: In particular, if large-scale solutions are being developed, significant savings can be realized. All types of testing can benefit, but large-scale load testing and regression testing are great uses."
    + "Supplementing on-demand capacity: Low-priority VMs can be used to supplement regular dedicated VMs - when available, jobs can scale and therefore complete quicker for lower cost; when not available, the baseline of dedicated VMs remains available."
    + "Flexible job execution time: If there is flexibility in the time jobs have to complete, then potential drops in capacity can be tolerated; however, with the addition of low-priority VMs jobs frequently run faster and for a lower cost."

    + "The Visual Studio Tools for Docker development workflow is similar to the workflow when using Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI. In fact, it's based on the same Docker CLI, but it's easier to get started, simplifies the process, and provides greater productivity for the build, run, and compose tasks. Execute and debug your containers via simple actions like F5 and Ctrl+F5. With the optional container orchestration support, in addition to being able to run and debug a single container, you can run and debug a group of containers (a whole solution) at the same time."
	+ "There are two levels of Docker support you can add to a project. In .NET Core web app projects, you can just add a Dockerfile file to the project by enabling Docker support. The next level is container orchestration support, which adds a Dockerfile to the project (if it doesn't already exist) and a docker-compose.yml file at the solution level. Container orchestration support, via Docker Compose, is added by default in Visual Studio 2017 versions 15.7 or earlier. Container orchestration support is an opt-in feature in Visual Studio 2017 versions 15.8 or later, in which case Docker Compose and Service Fabric are supported."

## Azure Application Service Environments (ASE)
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/intro
  + "The Azure App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale."
  + "ASEs are isolated to running only a single customer's applications and are always deployed into a virtual network."
  + "Customers have fine-grained control over inbound and outbound application network traffic."
  + "Applications can establish high-speed secure connections over VPNs to on-premises corporate resources."
  + https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase
	+ "Azure App Service Environment is a deployment of Azure App Service into a subnet in an Azure virtual network (VNet). There are two ways to deploy an App Service Environment (ASE):"
	  + "With a VIP on an external IP address, often called an External ASE."
      + "With a VIP on an internal IP address, often called an ILB ASE because the internal endpoint is an internal load balancer (ILB)."

 + https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/network-info
   + "There are two versions of App Service Environment: ASEv1 and ASEv2. For information on ASEv1, see Introduction to App Service Environment v1. ASEv1 can be deployed in a classic or Resource Manager VNet. ASEv2 can only be deployed into a Resource Manager VNet."
   + "The size of the subnet used to host an ASE cannot be altered after the ASE is deployed."
   + "When you scale up or down, new roles of the appropriate size are added and then your workloads are migrated from the current size to the target size. Only after your apps are migrated are the original VMs removed. This means that if you had an ASE with 100 ASP instances ```there would be a period where you need double the number of VMs.``` It is for this reason that we recommend the use of a '/24' to accommodate any changes you might require.

It uses the ase template to establish an App Service Environment with a Web App. It also uses the ase-agent template to deploy a VSTS/TFS agent in the Virtual Network and connect this agent with a VSTS or TFS instance.
